        Ruairi, who has described Aoife as warm and adventurous, said: “After a previous attempt to wake Aoife was unsuccessful, we’re incredibly grateful to share that today (December 26) she was brought out of her coma.”<br>
<br>
“She is now awake and showing really positive signs, right in line with what doctors would hope for after everything she’s been through. Above all else, our biggest prayer was for Aoife to wake up, and that prayer has been answered.”<br>
<br>
“Now that she’s awake, further tests can be carried out, and we’ll begin to get a clearer picture of the road ahead. We have been overwhelmed by the messages, prayers, kindness, and generosity shown to Aoife and our family.”

        Sparklers on Champagne Bottles the likely cause of Swiss
        Fire that left more than 40 Young People Dead
      </h3>

        A fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort appears to have been caused by sparklers placed on bottles of champagne that came "too close to the ceiling", authorities said.<br>
        <br>
        Forty people died after the blaze in the early hours of New Year's Day in Crans-Montana, while 119 were injured.<br>
        <br>
        Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud told a news conference on Friday the investigation would focus on the materials used on the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time of the fire.<br>
        <br>
        The investigation will explore whether prosecutions will be necessary. "If that is the case, and if those people are still alive, there will be a case opened against them," she said.

        Nigerian police have charged Anthony Joshua’s driver with causing death by dangerous driving after a fatal crash that killed two people.<br>
        <br>
        Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, was also charged with driving without a valid driving licence and “driving without due care and attention, causing bodily harm and damage to property”. He is due to appear in court on 20 January.<br>
        <br>
        The Federal Road Safety Corps in Nigeria said they believed the vehicle was travelling “beyond the legally prescribed speed limit”.<br>
        <br>
        Kayode was driving the former world heavyweight boxing champion, Joshua, 36, his personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, on 29 December on a busy highway linking Lagos and Ibadan in south-west Nigeria.

        GTA 6 Release Date Scheduled for November 19th 2026

        Rockstar Games have announced that the highly anticipated sixth edition of Grand Theft Auto will be released later this year on the 19th of November 2026.<br>
        <br>
        The game was initially meant to be released in the Summer of 2026, however like several times before the release date was pushed back to ensure readjustments could be made on time. This had left a lot of fans disappointed as the release of GTA 6 in the summer would’ve been great for during summer holidays and the 2026 World Cup.<br>
        <br>
GTA 6 will mainly be set in the fictional state Leonida which is based on the state of Florida and the main city will be Vice City which is meant to imitate Miami.
